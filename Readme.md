# Message app
This project is associated with the course INF5057 at the University of Oslo.

# Please look at the branches
We use branching to split the different apps
* Master (info)
* message-app: The message (file upload) app
* social: The social sharing app
* shared: the basic setup

# We have also created
  ... a file server (used in the message app). This is located in
  [github.com/mariusmu/dhis2-jmo-fileserver](https://github.com/mariusmu/dhis2-jmo-fileserver)

# About
This app is made for the DHIS2 platform, and will add extra functionality
to the message feature.


# Main goal
Add support for embedding images and files onto messages sent by users.

# Current status
We have implemented
- Functionality to share pivot tables (or other favorites to Facebook/Twitter
- Share files on messages (image display and attachments)

Again, please look at the different branches to see the updates
