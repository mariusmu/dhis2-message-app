# Task C (social sharing/message attachment)
This project is associated with the course INF5750 at the University of Oslo.

# Please look at the branches
We use branching to split the different apps
* Master (info)
* message-app: The message (file upload) app
* social: The social sharing app
* shared: the basic setup

# We have also created
  ... a file server (used in the message app). This is located in
  [github.com/mariusmu/dhis2-jmo-fileserver](https://github.com/mariusmu/dhis2-jmo-fileserver)
  
  ... a social native app embedded into DHIS2. Please check the following repository:
  [github.com/AndreOphelie/dhis-web-dashboard-integration](https://github.com/AndreOphelie/dhis-web-dashboard-integration)

# About
This app is made for the DHIS2 platform, and will add extra functionality
to the message feature, and add a social sharing functionnality (to the dashboard, or with an app).


# Main goal
Add support for embedding images and files onto messages sent by users.
Add social sharing functionality (Facebook and Twitter) for favorites data (maps, charts and pivot tables).

# Current status
We have implemented
- Functionality to share maps, charts and pivot tables (to Facebook/Twitter), in 2 different ways (native/web app).
- Share files on messages (image display and attachments)

Again, please look at the different branches to see the updates.
